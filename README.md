## üßæ Security & Compliance

### üß© KYC (Know Your Customer)
A **custom and robust KYC verification system** ensures identity validation before granting access to sensitive actions.

#### Verification Steps
1. Validation of personal data (name, surname, national ID number).
2. Upload and validation of **national ID image**.
3. **Facial verification** by comparing:
   - ID photo, and
   - Live photo/video of the user (future integration).

#### Data Security
- All images are **locally encrypted** or stored via a **secure third-party service**.
- KYC can be:
  - **Automatic**, via `face-api` or an LLM-based verification model.
  - **Manual**, by an administrator.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No sensitive operation (e.g., group creation, contribution, fund transfer) is allowed without prior KYC verification.
